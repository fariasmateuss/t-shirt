## Design Credit

This interface was inspired by the design available on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/5318677-T-Shirt-Landing-Page).

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/fariasmateuss/t-shirt.git
```

### Install anywhere (Standalone)

> If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running.

```
npm install -g sass
```

### Preprocessing

When you install Sass on the command line, you'll be able to run the sass executable to compile .sass and .scss files to .css files.

```
sass --watch src/styles/index.scss build/css/index.css
```

### Serve website

I used the package `serve` to run it in the browser through a node server.

> Node.js is required.

```
  npx serve .
```

_or_

```
./node_modules/.bin/serve .
```

Open the website on localhost or your network address.
